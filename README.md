# PacMan Factory
This project creates a PacMan icon at the press of a button and sends the icon flying across a web browser. The speed and initial direction are random.  

How to Run: Fork the repo and keep all files in the same directory. Update the styling, HTML, or JavaScript as needed.

Roadmap of future improvements: Change the icon and color when each icon encounters a wall, top, or bottom of the browser window.
